        This method persists a batch of data elements, always a list,

        It is recommended to persist objects of Python built-in types only,

        One useful pattern is to :meth:`append` output of ``custom_instance.to_dict()``,

        the persisted dict back to the custom type.

        If a subclass wants to perform such ``to_dict``/``from_dict``
        transformations for the user, it can customize :meth:`dump_data_file`
        and :meth:`load_data_file`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path
            Passed on to :meth:`BiglistBase.new`.
        batch_size
            Max number of data elements in each persisted data file.

            There's no good default value for this parameter, although one is
            provided (currently the default is 1000),
            because the code of :meth:`new` doesn't know
            the typical size of the data elements. User is recommended to
            specify the value of this parameter.

            In choosing a value for ``batch_size``, the most important
            consideration is the size of each data file, which is determined
            by the typical size of the data elements as well as ``batch_size``,
            which is the upper bound of the the number of elements in each file.

            There are several considerations about the data file sizes:

            - It should not be so small that the file reading/writing is a large
              overhead relative to actual processing of the data.
              This is especially important when ``path`` is cloud storage.

            - It should not be so large that it is "unwieldy", e.g. approaching 1GB.

            - When :meth:`__iter__`\\ating over a :class:`Biglist` object, there can be up to (by default) 4
              files-worth of data in memory at any time, where 4 is ``self._n_read_threads`` plus 1.

            - When :meth:`append`\\ing or :meth:`extend`\\ing to a :class:`Biglist` object at high speed,
              there can be up to (by default) 9 times ``batch_size`` data elements in memory at any time,
              where 9 is ``self._n_write_threads`` plus 1.
              See :meth:`_flush` and :class:`~biglist._biglist.Dumper`.

            Another consideration is access pattern of elements in the :class:`Biglist`. If
            there are many "jumping around" with random element access, large data files
            will lead to very wasteful file loading, because to read any element,
            its hosting file must be read into memory. (After all, if the application is
            heavy on random access, then :class:`Biglist` is **not** the right tool.)

            The performance of iteration is not expected to be highly sensitive to the value
            of ``batch_size``, as long as it is in a reasonable range.

            A rule of thumb: it is recommended to keep the persisted files between 32-128MB
            in size. (Note: no benchmark was performed to back this recommendation.)
        storage_format
            This should be a key in :data:`registered_storage_formats`.
            If not specified, :data:`DEFAULT_STORAGE_FORMAT` is used.
        serialize_kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments to the serialization function.
        deserialize_kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments to the deserialization function.

            ``serialize_kwargs`` and ``deserialize_kwargs`` are rarely needed.
            One use case is ``schema`` when storage format is "parquet".
            See :class:`~biglist._biglist.ParquetSerializer`.

            ``serialize_kwargs`` and ``deserialize_kwargs``, if not ``None``,
            will be saved in the "info.json" file, hence they must be JSON
            serializable, meaning they need to be the few simple native Python
            types that are supported by the standard ``json`` library.
            (However, the few formats "natively" supported by Biglist may get special treatment
            to relax this requirement.)
            If this is not possible, there are two solutions:

            1. Define a subclass of ``Biglist``. The subclass can customize the ``classmethod``\\s
               :meth:`dump_data_file` and :meth:`load_data_file` to handle extra serialization options
               internally.
            2. Define a custom serialization class and register it with :meth:`register_storage_format`.
        **kwargs
            additional arguments are passed on to :meth:`BiglistBase.new`.

        :meth:`_flush` is called automatically whenever the "append buffer"
        is full, so to persist the data and empty the buffer.
        (The capacity of this buffer is equal to ``self.batch_size``.)
        However, if this buffer is only partially filled when the user is done
        adding elements to the biglist, the data in the buffer will not be persisted.
        This is the first reason that user should call ``flush`` when they are done
        adding data (via :meth:`append` or :meth:`extend`).

        Although :meth:`_flush` creates new data files, it does not update the "meta info file"
        (``info.json`` in the root of ``self.path``) to include the new data files;
        it only updates the in-memory ``self.info``. This is for efficiency reasons,
        because updating ``info.json`` involves locking.

        Updating ``info.json`` to include new data files (created due to :meth:`append` and :meth:`extend`)
        is performed by :meth:`flush`.
        This is the second reason that user should call :meth:`flush` at the end of their
        data writting session, regardless of whether all the new data have been persisted
        in data files. (They would be if their count happens to be a multiple of ``self.batch_size``.)

        If there are multiple workers adding data to this biglist at the same time
        (from multiple processes or machines), data added by one worker will not be visible
        to another worker until the writing worker calls :meth:`flush` and the reading worker
        calls :meth:`reload`.

        Further, user should assume that data not yet persisted (i.e. still in "append buffer")
        are not visible to data reading via :meth:`__getitem__` or :meth:`__iter__` and not included in
        :meth:`__len__`, even to the same worker. In common use cases, we do not start reading data
        until we're done adding data to the biglist (at least "for now"), hence this is not
        a big issue.

        In summary, call :meth:`flush` when

        - You are done adding data (for this "session")
        - or you need to start reading data

        :meth:`flush` has overhead. You should call it only in the two situations above.
        **Do not** call it frequently "just to be safe".

        After a call to ``flush()``, there's no problem to add more elements again by
        :meth:`append` or :meth:`extend`. Data files created by ``flush()`` with less than
        :data:`batch_size` elements will stay as is among larger files.
        This is a legitimate case in parallel or distributed writing, or writing in
        multiple sessions.

class Multiplexer:
    """
    Multiplexer is used to distribute data elements to multiple "workers" so that
    each element is obtained by exactly one worker.

    Typically, the data element is small in size but requires significant time to process
    by the worker. The data elements are "hyper parameters".

    The usage consists of two main parts:

    1. In "controller" code, call :meth:`start` to start a new "session".
    Different sessions (at the same time or otherwise) are independent consumers of the data.

    2. In "worker" code, use the session ID that was returned by :meth:`start` to instantiate
    a Multiplexer and iterate over it. In so doing, multiple workers will obtain the data elements
    collectively, i.e., each element is obtained by exactly one worker.

        Parameters
        ----------

        path
            A non-existent directory where the data and any supporting info will be saved.
