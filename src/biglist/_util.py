    The protocol ``Seq`` is simpler and broader than the standard |Sequence|_.
    The former requires/provides only ``__len__``, ``__getitem__``, and ``__iter__``,
    whereas the latter adds ``__contains__``, ``__reversed__``, ``index`` and ``count``
    to these three. Although the extra methods can be implemented using the three basic methods,
    they could be massively inefficient in particular cases, and that is the case
    in the applications targeted by ``biglist``.
    For this reason, the classes defined in this package implement the protocol ``Seq``
    rather than ``Sequence``, to prevent the illusion that methods ``__contains__``, etc.,
    are usable.

    A class that implements this protocol is sized, iterable, and subscriptable by an int index.
    This is a subset of the methods provided by Sequence.
    In particular, Sequence implements this protocol, hence is considered a subclass
    of Seq for type checking purposes:

    >>> from biglist import Seq
    >>> from collections.abc import Sequence
    >>> issubclass(Sequence, Seq)
    True

    # an intended subclass.

    # in "cpython/Lib/_collections_abc.py", then a `Seq` inheriting from
