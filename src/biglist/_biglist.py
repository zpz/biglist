        Parameters
        ----------
        path
            Passed on to :meth:`BiglistBase.new` of ``BiglistBase``.
        batch_size
            Max number of data elements in each persisted data file.

            There's no good default value for this parameter, although one is
            provided (currently the default is 10000),
            because the code of :meth:`new` doesn't know
            the typical size of the data elements. User is recommended to
            specify the value of this parameter.

            In choosing a value for ``batch_size``, the most important
            consideration is the size of each data file, which is determined
            by the typical size of the data elements as well as ``batch_size``,
            which is the upper bound of the the number
            of elements in each file.

            There are several considerations about the data file sizes:

            - It should not be so small that the file reading/writing is a large
              overhead relative to actual processing of the data.
              This is especially important when ``path`` is cloud storage.

            - It should not be so large that it is "unwieldy", e.g. approaching 1GB.

            - When :meth:`~_base.BiglistBase.__iter__`\\ating over a :class:`Biglist` object, there can be up to (by default) 4
              files-worth of data in memory at any time. See the method :meth:`iter_files`.

            - When :meth:`append`\\ing or :meth:`extend`\\ing to a :class:`Biglist` object at high speed,
              there can be up to (by default) 4 times ``batch_size`` data elements in memory at any time.
              See :meth:`_flush` and :class:`Dumper`.

            Another consideration is access pattern of elements in the :class:`Biglist`. If
            there are many "jumping around" with random element access, large data files
            will lead to very wasteful file loading, because to read any element,
            its hosting file must be read into memory. (After all, if the application is
            heavy on random access, then :class:`Biglist` is **not** the right tool.)

            The performance of iteration is not expected to be highly sensitive to the value
            of ``batch_size``, as long as it is in a reasonable range.

            A rule of thumb: it is recommended to keep the persisted files between 32-128MB
            in size. (Note: no benchmark was performed to back this recommendation.)

        storage_format
            This should be a key in :data:`registered_storage_formats`.
            If not specified, :data:`DEFAULT_STORAGE_FORMAT` is used.

        Although :meth:`_flush` creates new data files, it does not update the "meta info file"
        (``info.json`` in the root of ``self.path``) to include the new data files;
        it only updates the in-memory ``self.info``. This is for efficiency reasons,
        because updating ``info.json`` involves locking.

        Updating ``info.json`` to include new data files (created due to :meth:`append` and :meth:`extend`)
        if performed by :meth:`flush`.
        This is the second reason that user should call :meth:`flush` at the end of their
        data writting session, regardless of whether all the new data have been persisted
        in data files. (They would be if their count is a multiple of ``self.batch_size``.)

        If there are multiple workers adding data to this biglist at the same time
        (from multiple processes or machines), data added by other workers will be
        invisible to this worker until :meth:`flush` or :meth:`reload` is called.

        Further, user should assume that data not yet persisted are not visible to
        data reading via :meth:`__getitem__` or :meth:`__iter__`, and not included in
        :meth:`__len__`. In common use cases, we do not start reading data until we're done
        adding data to the biglist (at least "for now").

        In summary, call :meth:`flush` when

        - You are done adding data (for this "session")
        - or you need to start reading data

        :meth:`flush` has overhead. You should call it only in the two situations above.
        **Do not** call it frequently "just to be safe".

        After a call to ``flush()``, there's no problem to add more elements again by
        :meth:`append` or :meth:`extend`. Data files created by ``flush()`` with less than
        :data:`batch_size` elements will stay as is among larger files.
        This is a legitimate case in parallel or distributed writing, or writing in
        multiple sessions.
