        Create a new object of this class (of a subclass, to be precise) and then add data to it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path
            A directory in which this :class:`BiglistBase` will save whatever it needs to save.

            The directory must be non-existent.
            It is not necessary to pre-create the parent directory of this path.

            This path can be either on local disk or in a cloud storage.

            If not specified, :meth:`BiglistBase.get_temp_path`
            is called to determine a temporary path.

            The subclass :class:`~biglist.Biglist` saves both data and meta-info in this path.
            The subclass :class:`~biglist.ParquetBiglist` saves meta-info only.

        init_info
            Initial info that should be written into the *info* file before ``__init__`` is called.
            This is in addition to whatever this method internally decides to write.

            The info file `info.json` is written before :meth:`__init__` is called.
            In :meth:`__init__`, this file is read into ``self.info``.

            This parameter can be used to write some high-level info that ``__init__``
            needs.

            If the info is not needed in ``__init__``, then user can always add it
            to ``self.info`` after the object has been instantiated, hence saving general info
            in ``info.json`` is not the intended use of this parameter.

            User rarely needs to use this parameter. It is mainly used by the internals
            of the method ``new`` of subclasses.
        **kwargs
            additional arguments are passed on to :meth:`__init__`.

        Notes
        -----
        A :class:`BiglistBase` object construction is in either of the two modes
        below:

        a) create a new :class:`BiglistBase` to store new data.

        b) create a :class:`BiglistBase` object pointing to storage of
           existing data, which was created by a previous call to :meth:`new`.

        In case (a), one has called :meth:`new`. In case (b), one has called
        ``BiglistBase(..)`` (i.e. :meth:`__init__`).

        Some settings are applicable only in mode (a), b/c in
        mode (b) they can't be changed and, if needed, should only
        use the value already set in mode (a).
        Such settings can be parameters to :meth:`new`
        but should not be parameters to :meth:`__init__`.
        Examples include ``storage_format`` and ``batch_size`` for the subclass :class:`~biglist.Biglist`.
        These settings typically should be taken care of in :meth:`new`,
        before and/or after the object has been created by a call to :meth:`__init__`
        within :meth:`new`.

        :meth:`__init__` should be defined in such a way that it works for
        both a barebone object that is created in this :meth:`new`, as well as a
        fleshed out object that already has data in persistence.

        Some settings may be applicable to an existing :class:`BiglistBase` object, e.g.,
        they control styles of display and not intrinsic attributes persisted along
        with the BiglistBase.
        Such settings should be parameters to :meth:`__init__` but not to :meth:`new`.
        If provided in a call to :meth:`new`, these parameters will be passed on to :meth:`__init__`.

        Subclass authors should keep these considerations in mind.

            Passed on to :meth:`BiglistBase.new`.
        batch_size
            Max number of data elements in each persisted data file.

            There's no good default value for this parameter, although one is
            provided (currently the default is 1000),
            because the code of :meth:`new` doesn't know
            the typical size of the data elements. User is recommended to
            specify the value of this parameter.

            In choosing a value for ``batch_size``, the most important
            consideration is the size of each data file, which is determined
            by the typical size of the data elements as well as ``batch_size``,
            which is the upper bound of the the number of elements in each file.

            There are several considerations about the data file sizes:

            - It should not be so small that the file reading/writing is a large
              overhead relative to actual processing of the data.
              This is especially important when ``path`` is cloud storage.

            - It should not be so large that it is "unwieldy", e.g. approaching 1GB.

            - When :meth:`__iter__`\\ating over a :class:`Biglist` object, there can be up to (by default) 4
              files-worth of data in memory at any time, where 4 is ``self._n_read_threads`` plus 1.

            - When :meth:`append`\\ing or :meth:`extend`\\ing to a :class:`Biglist` object at high speed,
              there can be up to (by default) 9 times ``batch_size`` data elements in memory at any time,
              where 9 is ``self._n_write_threads`` plus 1.
              See :meth:`_flush` and :class:`~biglist._biglist.Dumper`.

            Another consideration is access pattern of elements in the :class:`Biglist`. If
            there are many "jumping around" with random element access, large data files
            will lead to very wasteful file loading, because to read any element,
            its hosting file must be read into memory. (After all, if the application is
            heavy on random access, then :class:`Biglist` is **not** the right tool.)

            The performance of iteration is not expected to be highly sensitive to the value
            of ``batch_size``, as long as it is in a reasonable range.

            A rule of thumb: it is recommended to keep the persisted files between 32-128MB
            in size. (Note: no benchmark was performed to back this recommendation.)
        storage_format
            This should be a key in :data:`registered_storage_formats`.
            If not specified, :data:`DEFAULT_STORAGE_FORMAT` is used.
        serialize_kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments to the serialization function.
        deserialize_kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments to the deserialization function.

            ``serialize_kwargs`` and ``deserialize_kwargs`` are rarely needed.
            One use case is ``schema`` when storage format is "parquet".
            See :class:`~biglist._biglist.ParquetSerializer`.

            ``serialize_kwargs`` and ``deserialize_kwargs``, if not ``None``,
            will be saved in the "info.json" file, hence they must be JSON
            serializable, meaning they need to be the few simple native Python
            types that are supported by the standard ``json`` library.
            (However, the few formats "natively" supported by Biglist may get special treatment
            to relax this requirement.)
            If this is not possible, the solution is to define a custom serialization class and
            register it with :meth:`register_storage_format`.
        **kwargs
            additional arguments are passed on to :meth:`BiglistBase.new`.

        However, if this buffer is only partially filled when the user is done
        adding elements to the biglist, the data in the buffer will not be persisted.
        This is the first reason that user should call ``flush`` when they are done
        adding data (via :meth:`append` or :meth:`extend`).

        Although :meth:`_flush` creates new data files, it does not update the "meta info file"
        (``info.json`` in the root of ``self.path``) to include the new data files;
        it only updates the in-memory ``self.info``. This is for efficiency reasons,
        because updating ``info.json`` involves locking.

        Updating ``info.json`` to include new data files (created due to :meth:`append` and :meth:`extend`)
        is performed by :meth:`flush`.
        This is the second reason that user should call :meth:`flush` at the end of their
        data writing session, regardless of whether all the new data have been persisted
        in data files. (They would be if their count happens to be a multiple of ``self.batch_size``.)

        If there are multiple workers adding data to this biglist at the same time
        (from multiple processes or machines), data added by one worker will not be visible
        to another worker until the writing worker calls :meth:`flush` and the reading worker
        calls :meth:`reload`.

        Further, user should assume that data not yet persisted (i.e. still in "append buffer")
        are not visible to data reading via :meth:`__getitem__` or :meth:`__iter__` and not included in
        :meth:`__len__`, even to the same worker. In common use cases, we do not start reading data
        until we're done adding data to the biglist (at least "for now"), hence this is not
        a big issue.

        In summary, call :meth:`flush` when

        - You are done adding data (for this "session")
        - or you need to start reading data

        :meth:`flush` has overhead. You should call it only in the two situations above.
        **Do not** call it frequently "just to be safe".

        After a call to ``flush()``, there's no problem to add more elements again by
        :meth:`append` or :meth:`extend`. Data files created by ``flush()`` with less than
        :data:`batch_size` elements will stay as is among larger files.
        This is a legitimate case in parallel or distributed writing, or writing in
        multiple sessions.

        Note: the above talks about the "default" behavior, where `eager` is `False`.

        The parameter `eager` is provided for the following situation:

        Suppose we use many distributed workers to concurrently write to a biglist,
        and the biglist is saved in a cloud blob store (such as Google Cloud Storage).
        By default, `flush` will lock the info file to update things.
        If `flush` is being called by many workers at around the same time,
        the locking could make the workers wait for for a while; worse, some workers
        could fail to acquire a lock due to timeout.

        In such situations, you can use `eager=True`. Then, the info file is not updated, nor
        locked. Each caller independently saves a file for its meta data (that is supposed to
        be merged into the info file), in addition to saving data files. As such, all necessary
        info is persisted, yet it is not properly merged into the overall info file, hence
        the data structure is in an incomplete state.

        If `eager=True` has been used, then `flush` with `eager=False` (the default)
        needs to be called at least once before *reading* the data.

        `flush` is called when a Biglist object is garbage collected.
        However, user is recommended to explicitly call `flush` at the end of their writing session.
